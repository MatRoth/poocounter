# poocounter

Small shiny app to count poo, pee and feeding events from babys and calculate some statistics and visualizations.

## Current version
At the moment the data entry form is completed. Only a way to modify already entried data is missing. 
The analysis tab contains times since last poo/feed event. Also calculates the probabiltiy that the baby will
poo in the next 30 minutes using a gamma distribution fitted on the time between poo events.
